**Library Management System: A Case Study focussing on strings and dictionaries.**

Task: In an effort to move away from their physical management system, the
library wants a digital solution to manage book checkouts, returns and reservations
efficiently.

This system is to be created using lists and dictionaries.

The concepts consolidated by this case study:
- String Handling
- Implementing Dictionary & List Manipulation
- Functions for calculations/computations

Once the user has inputted the desired text into the document, the following features will be offered to the user:
- The program should use lists and dictionaries to keep track of various details
- Handle common library operations like checking out a book, which would
decrease the number of available copies and add the book to the user's borrowed list.
- Prevent users from borrowing more books than allowed and calculate fines for
late returns.
